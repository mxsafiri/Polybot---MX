# Railway-specific proxy configuration
# Use a free proxy service to bypass Cloudflare blocking
# Add this to your Railway environment variables

# Option 1: Using a proxy service (recommended)
# HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
# HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Option 2: Using a rotating proxy service
# You can use services like:
# - Bright Data (formerly Luminati)
# - Smartproxy
# - Oxylabs
# - ScraperAPI

# For now, the bot will work without a proxy on your local machine
# On Railway, you may need to add a proxy URL if Cloudflare continues blocking
